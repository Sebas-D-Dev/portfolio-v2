npm test
```

### Linting
To check code quality and formatting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

The portfolio is configured for easy deployment to various platforms:

### Vercel (Recommended)
As a Next.js project, it's optimized for deployment on Vercel:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings
3. Your site will be deployed and updated on each push to the main branch

### Other Hosting Options
The project can also be deployed to Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any other static hosting service after building.
